# IT-Bootcamp_final_work


<p align="center">Project Description</p>
<p> At the end of our journey in IT-Bootcamp, the final task was to create a website. I created a website that is an online movie library. I used HTML and CSS for the frontend, and PHP (mostly OOP) for the background.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to my first website, which contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home page, where you can register via email and password, after successful registration, so you can easily log in and explore the website.</li>
<li>Shopping cart - Choose the movie that suits you best, read a little more about it and put it in the shopping cart, "buy it" and all your actions will be recorded in the database.</li>
<li>An administrator page that is set to private, you can log in with the username: admin and password: the1incharge and make changes to the web store.</li>
<li>Database - created in PHPMiAdmin that stores all purchases, all user data and movies.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>I hope you enjoy.</p>
